# Product Overview

doctk is a composable, functional toolkit for structured document manipulation.

## Core Philosophy

Inspired by category theory, set theory, and the Zen of Python:

- **Composable**: Complex operations built from simple primitives
- **Pure**: Operations transform rather than mutate (immutable)
- **Format-agnostic**: Operates on universal document AST
- **Type-safe**: Well-typed transformations
- **Pipeable**: Unix-philosophy pipelines for documents

## Key Features

- Document parsing (Markdown, with RST/HTML/Confluence planned)
- Composable operations (select, filter, promote, demote, nest, unnest)
- Document outliner with tree visualization
- CLI interface with demo and outline commands
- Python API with pipe operator syntax
- DSL (Domain-Specific Language) for document manipulation
- LSP server for editor integration
- VS Code extension (TypeScript)

## Current Status

Version 0.1.0 (Alpha - POC Complete)

Core abstractions, Markdown support, basic operations, and CLI are implemented. Working toward v0.2 with enhanced node types and structure operations.
